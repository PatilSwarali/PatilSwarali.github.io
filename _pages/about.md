## Hello! I am Swarali. Welcome to my homepage, it is under construction.


* ### I am a first year graduate student at West Virginia University. My research interests are in the domain of astronomy. I currently work with Dr. Emmanuel Fonseca at WVU. I am a member of the <a href="https://chime-experiment.ca/en"> Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) </a> collaboration.

* ### Previously, I have worked in the field of cosmology, star formation and pulsar timing. Please find my <a href="https://PatilSwarali.github.io/cv/"> CV </a> page for more info.

* ### Along with physics and research, music is an integral part of my life. More about it in the <a href="https://PatilSwarali.github.io/misc/"> miscellaneous </a> page.


##### Thank you for stopping by.
