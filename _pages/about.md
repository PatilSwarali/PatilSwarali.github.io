## Hello! I am Swarali. Welcome to my homepage, it is under construction.

* ### Previously, I have worked in the field of cosmology, star formation and pulsar timing. Please find my CV page for more info.

* ### When not working, I enjoy singing, taking long walks and cooking up Maharashtrian dishes.


##### Thank you for stopping by.
