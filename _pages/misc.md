Music
------

I received the gift of music from my talented parents. Since I was little, they introduced to many instruments and a range of compositions at home. I started my formal training in Hindustani Classical vocals and harmonium when I was 10 under Mrs. Simantini Jahagirdar in Pune. I completed Madhyama Pratham in vocals from Gandharva Mahavidyalaya with distinction. Although my formal training in music took a pause after I moved for college, I continue to practice it.

I enjoy learning new musical instruments. It's wonderful how the underlying physics is seemingly simple and same in all of music yet, it can make us feel so many things in so many different ways.
