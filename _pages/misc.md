## Music
------
It's wonderful how the underlying physics is seemingly simple and same in all of music yet, it can make us feel so many things in so many different ways.

I received the gift of music from my talented parents. At home, I was introduced to a range of instruments and compositions. I started my formal training in Hindustani Classical vocals and harmonium when I was 10 under my guru **Mrs. Simantini Jahagirdar** in Pune. I completed Madhyama Pratham in vocals from **Gandharva Mahavidyalaya** with distinction. Although my formal training in music took a pause after I moved for college, I continue to pursue music. In IISER TVM, I was a part of a classical fusion band. I was featured on **Kappa TV**, a Kerala based music TV channel. Here is a link to the [performance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9a6tmVkYZo) that aired [](https://www.google.com) on TV in Feb 2020.


Gaansaraswati Kishori ji Amonkar and Pt. Hridaynath Mangeshkar are my musical idols. I developed an appreciation for western music through my friends. U2, Fleetwood Mac, Queen are my favorites.

 I enjoy cooking. I believe food is more than just for sustenance.
