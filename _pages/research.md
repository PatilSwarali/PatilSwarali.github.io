I am currently working on Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with the CHIME Telescope. FRBs are strong radio emission signals originating from sources that are not fully identified yet. These bursts are sporadic and have an extremely small duration ranging from a few micro-seconds to milli-seconds. My work involves using and developing computational methods to process the telescope data and/or in the hope of possibly discovering some relevant physical phenomena.

## My research interests are:
  * Neutron stars and transients
  * Interstellar medium
  * Stellar formation and evolution
  * Cosmic Microwave Background

## Previous projects:

* ### Effect of Weak Gravitational Lensing on CMB:

The dark matter in the universe does not interact with light. However, due to its gravity, it can bend light. The Cosmic Microwave Background is the radiation from the earliest times of the universe. These photons deflect due to the
For my master's thesis, I worked under the guidance of Dr. Soumen Basak at IISER TVM. We computationally calculated the power spectrum of
